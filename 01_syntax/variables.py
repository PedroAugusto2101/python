# Variables are used to store something in the computer's memory.
# PEP8: start variable names with lowercase letters; you can use numbers and underscores _.
# The = sign is the assignment operator. It is used toassign a value to a name (variable).
# Usage: variable_name = expression

# full_name = 'Pedro Augusto Andrade Silva'
# sum_two_plus_two = 2 + 2
# int_one = bool('1')
# print(int_one, type(int_one))
# print(full_name, sum_two_plus_two)
